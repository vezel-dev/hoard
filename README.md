# Hoard

This repository hosts a collection of specifications and reference manuals for a
variety of contemporary and historical instruction set architectures, mostly for
real CPUs and GPUs, but also some virtual ones. It should prove useful to anyone
working on compilers, emulators, operating systems, and other similar software.

To qualify for inclusion here, an ISA should in some sense be considered a
compilation target for the purpose of driving actual hardware and/or be generic
enough that essentially any programming language can be compiled to it
efficiently.

Archived documents can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/vezel-dev/hoard/releases).
